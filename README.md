# portfolio_website

[jeremybuist.ca](https://www.jeremybuist.ca/)

Codebase for my portfolio website. Built with React, Next.js, Typescript, and SASS.

This website was built with NextJS, Typescript, and SASS. It is hosted on Vercel and uses CircleCI for continuous integration.

The interactive 3D background was built with Three.js. The AI bot was made using Langchain, OpenAI, and Vercel's ai SDK, using information from a vector database to answer questions. The website is responsive and features the ability to generate a color scheme for the pages which populates throughout the website (try clicking the cube). The website also has accessibility features included on each page.

For this project, I wanted to showcase my personal style while demonstrating my ability to build a fully functional and responsive website. I built the components myself to demonstrate my ability to create and design front-end web components. This project was also my first experience using Typescript and Sendgrid.
